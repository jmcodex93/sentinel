"""Dockable host for the Fase 6.0 Panel SPA (``PanelSPADialog`` +
``SentinelPanelSPACmd``) — Task 2 of ``docs/superpowers/plans/
2026-07-21-panel-60-host.md``.

This is a NEW, separate command living alongside the untouched native panel
(``ui/panel.py`` ``YSPanel``/``YSPanelCmd``) — the parallel-panel strategy
the plan's Global Constraints call for. Nothing in ``panel.py`` is touched
here.

Two things had to be copied EXACTLY from existing, proven code rather than
reinvented:

- Dockable + layout-persistent registration: ``SentinelPanelSPACmd`` mirrors
  ``ui/panel.py`` ``YSPanelCmd`` (panel.py:2877-2893) field-for-field —
  ``Execute`` opens via ``dlg.Open(dlgtype=c4d.DLG_TYPE_ASYNC,
  pluginid=..., defaultw, defaulth)``, ``RestoreLayout`` calls
  ``dlg.Restore(pluginid=..., secret=sec_ref)``. This pairing is what makes
  a C4D command dockable and have its layout position/state persisted
  across restarts — a command that only implements ``Execute`` opens fine
  but forgets where it was docked.
- Dialog body: ``PanelSPADialog`` mirrors ``ui/reports_dialog.py``
  ``FormDialog``/``ReportsDialog`` — full-bleed ``CUSTOMGUI_HTMLVIEWER``,
  the same webbrowser fallback notice when the gadget isn't available on
  this platform/build, ``SetTimer(25)`` with ``Timer`` draining the SAME
  module-level ``MainThreadQueue`` those dialogs drain
  (``reports_dialog._queue`` via ``reports_dialog._dispatch``) plus the
  guarded ``pump_jobs()`` call — one queue, one server, for however many
  dialogs (native panel forms, Reports, Hub, and now this panel) are open
  at once; see ``reports_dialog``'s module docstring for why that is safe.
  Server startup goes through ``reports_dialog.ensure_server()`` — same
  lazy singleton, same missing-web-build error contract every other host in
  this codebase relies on.

Unlike ``FormDialog``, this dialog takes no ``page`` parameter: it always
points at the fixed ``?page=panel`` SPA route (the ``PanelPage`` Task 3
builds), so there is exactly one Panel SPA window, not one per page.

The command's own ``self.dlg`` reference IS the GC retention for this
dialog instance (identical to how ``YSPanelCmd`` already works) — no
separate registry is needed the way ``ui/reports_dialog.py``'s
``_open_form_dialogs``/``_open_reports_dialog`` module-level slots are
needed for THOSE call sites (a ``CommandData`` is itself a long-lived
singleton C4D holds onto for the life of the plugin, so its ``dlg``
attribute survives exactly as long as the command does).
